  This is the open-source repository of Spark's frontend!
</div>

## Working on the code

To work on the code, simply clone the repository, install all the needed dependencies by running

(with yarn installed)

```sh
yarn install
```

or (without yarn installed)

```sh
npm install
```

This should install all the needed modules, like Next.JS or framer-motion! For the next step, you can either modify the code or just simply run a development server (on http://localhost:3000/) by running one of these simple commands:

(with yarn installed)

```sh
yarn dev
```

or (without yarn installed)

```sh
npm dev
```
